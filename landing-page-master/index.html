    <h1>Some Cool Stories</h1>
    <div class="flex-columns">
      <p>Pre-Islamic Arabia, the territory that constitutes modern-day Saudi Arabia, was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations; the prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity outside Africa.[16] The world's second-largest religion,[17] Islam, emerged in what is now Saudi Arabia. In the early 7th century.</p>
        <p>The area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of mainly four distinct historical regions: Hejaz, Najd, and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa) and South Arabia ('Asir).[19] The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by King Abdulaziz (known as Ibn Saud in the West). He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh.</p>
          <p>Following the amalgamation of the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd, the new state was named al-Mamlaka al-ʿArabiyya as-Suʿūdiyya (a transliteration of المملكة العربية السعودية in Arabic) by royal decree on 23 September 1932 by its founder, Abdulaziz bin Saud. Although this is normally translated as "the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia" in English,[40] it literally means "the Saudi Arab kingdom",[41] or "the Arab Saudi Kingdom".[42]</p>
